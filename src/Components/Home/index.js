          Hello everyone,
          </p>
<p>
I am Kiruthika, and I am excited to introduce myself to the team at Lunacal.
</p>

I have recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Annai Women's College, where my academic journey was filled with both challenges and rewarding experiences in the field of technology.

One of my proudest achievements is winning first place in a prompt engineering competition conducted by the government, where my work was recognized by the district collector. This accomplishment highlighted the importance of creativity, collaboration, and perseverance, all of which I strive to bring to any role I take on.

Real-time chat application (https://github.com/kiruthikadev-r/chat-mern-project.git)
</p>
<p>
I developed a real-time chat application for my college community, enabling seamless communication among
students, faculty, and staff. It includes instant messaging, group chat, file sharing, and user-friendly interfaces. I
also integrated robust security measures to ensure privacy and confidentiality. The platform has been widely
adopted, enhancing collaboration and fostering a sense of community.
Technologies used: JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js, Node.js, Mongodb, Express.js
